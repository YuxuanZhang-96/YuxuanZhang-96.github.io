I am currently a last PhD candidate in Electronics supervised by Assoc. Prof. Sebastian Bader at the 
[Department of Computer and Electrical Engineering](https://www.miun.se/en/meet-mid-sweden-university/Organisation/departments/det/) and [Sensible Things that Communicate (STC) Research Centre](https://www.miun.se/en/Research/research-centers/stc/) at [Mid Sweden University](https://www.miun.se/en/) (2021.01-2025.09). 

After completing my PhD, I will join the [College of Intelligent Science and Engineering](https://en.bua.edu.cn/Colleges___Faculties/College_of_Intelligent_Science_and_Engineering.htm) of [Beijing Agricultural University](https://en.bua.edu.cn/) as a Lecturer (Assistant Professor) in Embedded Systems and Internet of Things.

My research interests include EdgeAI, IoT and their applications in Structural Health Monitoring, Precision Agriculture and Industrial Maintenance.  I have published 20+ papers in journals and conferences such as IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement, SENSORS, IEEE Sensors Applications Symposium (SAS), IEEE International Instrumentation and Measurement Technology Conference (I2MTC), IEEE World Forum on Internet of Things (WF-IoT). 

I am one of the 2024 IEEE TIM Outstanding Reviewer and also served as a reviewer for several prestigious journals and conferences:

ACM Computing Survey, <br>
IEEE Internet of Things Journal,  <br>
IEEE Trans. on Industrial Informatic,  <br>
IEEE Trans. on Instrumentation and Measurement,  <br>

.

Currently, I am also a student member of the [IEEE Instrumentation and Measurement Society](https://ieee-ims.org/)ï¼Œ IEEE, IEEE Sensors Council and Chinese Mechanical Engineering Society.

Background
======
I received my M.Sc from the [Embedded Systems Engineering](https://courses.leeds.ac.uk/f310/embedded-systems-engineering-msc-eng-) program supervised by Prof. Steven Freear at the University of Leeds (UK, 2019), and my B.Eng. from the [New Energy Science & Engineering](https://www.bistu.edu.cn/jyjx/bks/bkzy/202309/W020230920631589846740.doc) program at Beijing Information Science & Technology University (China, 2018). After receiving my M.Sc, I was at the [Institute of Microelectronics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences](http://www.ime.cas.cn/) as an assistant engineer for 7 months.
