(2026.02.06 Updated)

I am currently an Assistant Professor at the [College of Intelligent Science and Engineering](https://en.bua.edu.cn/Colleges___Faculties/College_of_Intelligent_Science_and_Engineering.htm) of [Beijing Agricultural University](https://en.bua.edu.cn/) and an Affiliated Researcher at the [Department of Computer and Electrical Engineering](https://www.miun.se/en/meet-mid-sweden-university/Organisation/departments/det/), [Mid Sweden University](https://www.miun.se/en/).

My research interests include EdgeAI, IoT and their applications in Structural Health Monitoring, Smart Agriculture and Industrial Maintenance.  I have published 30+ papers in peer-reviewed journals and conferences such as IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement, IEEE Internet of Things Journal, IEEE International Instrumentation and Measurement Technology Conference (I2MTC), IEEE Sensors Applications Symposium (SAS), IEEE World Forum on Internet of Things (WF-IoT), Nondestructive Testing and Evaluation, Engineering Structures, Frontiers in Plant Science, Structural Health Monitoring, Computer Vision and Image Understanding, Journal of King Aaud University Computer and Information Sciences, Scientific Reports. 

I am one of the 2024, 2025 IEEE TIM Outstanding Reviewer, one of the ten 2025 Information Processing in Agriculture Outstanding Reviewer, and also served as a reviewer for several prestigious journals and conferences, such as:

Background
======
I received my Ph.D in Electronics supervised by Assoc. Prof. Sebastian Bader at the 
[Department of Computer and Electrical Engineering](https://www.miun.se/en/meet-mid-sweden-university/Organisation/departments/det/) and [Sensible Things that Communicate (STC) Research Centre](https://www.miun.se/en/Research/research-centers/stc/) at [Mid Sweden University](https://www.miun.se/en/) (Sweden, 2021-2025), my M.Sc from the [Embedded Systems Engineering](https://courses.leeds.ac.uk/f310/embedded-systems-engineering-msc-eng-) program supervised by Prof. Steven Freear at the University of Leeds (UK, 2018-2019), and my B.Eng. from the [New Energy Science & Engineering](https://www.bistu.edu.cn/jyjx/bks/bkzy/202309/W020230920631589846740.doc) program at Beijing Information Science & Technology University (China, 2014-2018). After receiving my M.Sc, I was at the [Institute of Microelectronics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences](http://www.ime.cas.cn/) as an assistant engineer for 7 months.
