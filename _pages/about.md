(2025.10.30 Updated)

I am currently a Lecturer (Assistant Professor) in Embedded Systems and Internet of Things at the [College of Intelligent Science and Engineering](https://en.bua.edu.cn/Colleges___Faculties/College_of_Intelligent_Science_and_Engineering.htm) of [Beijing Agricultural University](https://en.bua.edu.cn/) and an Affiliated Researcher at the [Department of Computer and Electrical Engineering](https://www.miun.se/en/meet-mid-sweden-university/Organisation/departments/det/), [Mid Sweden University](https://www.miun.se/en/).

My research interests include EdgeAI, IoT and their applications in Structural Health Monitoring, Precision Agriculture and Industrial Maintenance.  I have published 20+ papers in peer-reviewed journals and conferences such as IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement, Nondestructive Testing and Evaluation, IEEE International Instrumentation and Measurement Technology Conference (I2MTC), IEEE Sensors Applications Symposium (SAS), IEEE World Forum on Internet of Things (WF-IoT). 

I am one of the 2024 IEEE TIM Outstanding Reviewer and also served as a reviewer for several prestigious journals and conferences:

Background
======
I received my Ph.D in Electronics supervised by Assoc. Prof. Sebastian Bader at the 
[Department of Computer and Electrical Engineering](https://www.miun.se/en/meet-mid-sweden-university/Organisation/departments/det/) and [Sensible Things that Communicate (STC) Research Centre](https://www.miun.se/en/Research/research-centers/stc/) at [Mid Sweden University](https://www.miun.se/en/) (Sweden, 2021-2025), my M.Sc from the [Embedded Systems Engineering](https://courses.leeds.ac.uk/f310/embedded-systems-engineering-msc-eng-) program supervised by Prof. Steven Freear at the University of Leeds (UK, 2018-2019), and my B.Eng. from the [New Energy Science & Engineering](https://www.bistu.edu.cn/jyjx/bks/bkzy/202309/W020230920631589846740.doc) program at Beijing Information Science & Technology University (China, 2014-2018). After receiving my M.Sc, I was at the [Institute of Microelectronics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences](http://www.ime.cas.cn/) as an assistant engineer for 7 months.
