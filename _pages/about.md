I am currently a PhD student in Electronics supervised by Assoc. Prof. Sebastian Bader at the 
[Department of Computer and Electrical Engineering](https://www.miun.se/en/meet-mid-sweden-university/Organisation/departments/det/) and [Sensible Things that Communicate (STC) Research Centre](https://www.miun.se/en/Research/research-centers/stc/) at [Mid Sweden University](https://www.miun.se/en/) (from 2021).

My research interests include Tiny Machine Learning, i.e., implementing machine learning algorithms on low-power and very resource-constrained devices, on-device training and their applications in Structural Health Monitoring and Precision Agriculture.  I have published 10+ papers in journals and conferences such as IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement, SENSORS, IEEE Sensors Applications Symposium (SAS), IEEE International Instrumentation and Measurement Technology Conference (I2MTC), IEEE World Forum on Internet of Things (WF-IoT). 

I am one of the 2024 IEEE TIM Outstanding Reviewer and also served as a reviewer for journals and conferences:
IEEE Sensors Journal, IEEE Trans. on Instrumentation and Measurement, IEEE Trans. Industrial Informatic, Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing, Structural Health Monitoring, Expert Systems with Applications, Measurement, Reliability Engineering & System Safety, Information Sciences and Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence, Information Processing in Agriculture, Computers and Electronics in Agriculture, Nondestructive Testing and Evaluation,  Sensors and Actuators A: Physical and IEEE Internet of Things Journal.

Currently, I am also a student member of the [IEEE Instrumentation and Measurement Society](https://ieee-ims.org/)ï¼Œ IEEE, IEEE Sensors Council and Chinese Mechanical Engineering Society.

Background
======
I received my M.Sc from the [Embedded Systems Engineering](https://courses.leeds.ac.uk/f310/embedded-systems-engineering-msc-eng-) program supervised by Prof. Steven Freear at the University of Leeds (UK, 2019), and my B.Eng. from the [New Energy Science & Engineering](https://www.bistu.edu.cn/jyjx/bks/bkzy/202309/W020230920631589846740.doc) program at Beijing Information Science & Technology University (China, 2018). After receiving my M.Sc, I was at the [Institute of Microelectronics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences](http://www.ime.cas.cn/) as an assistant engineer for 7 months.
